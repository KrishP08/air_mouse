## Project Plan: ESP32 & MPU6050 Device

### Core Components
This project is built using two primary components:
* **ESP32:** This microcontroller serves as the central processing unit. It has been specifically chosen for its integrated **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth** capabilities.
* **MPU6050:** An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) used for motion and orientation sensing.

### Connectivity
Data transfer between the ESP32 and the target device will be handled wirelessly via **Bluetooth**, leveraging the ESP32's built-in module.

### Development & Testing
For the initial development phase, I am using **Wokwi** for online code simulation and testing. While this is a suitable solution for now, I understand it doesn't fully replicate the behavior of real-world hardware.

### Version Control
Currently, there is no GitHub repository for this project. I plan to create one soon to manage the source code and document progress.
