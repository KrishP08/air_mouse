## Project Plan: ESP32 & MPU6050 Device

### Core Components
This project is built using two primary components:
* **ESP32:** This microcontroller serves as the central processing unit. It has been specifically chosen for its integrated **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth** capabilities.
* **MPU6050:** An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) used for motion and orientation sensing.

### Connectivity
Data transfer between the ESP32 and the target device will be handled wirelessly via **Bluetooth**, leveraging the ESP32's built-in module.

### Development & Testing
For the initial development phase, I am using **Wokwi** for online code simulation and testing. While this is a suitable solution for now, I understand it doesn't fully replicate the behavior of real-world hardware.

### Version Control
Currently, there is no GitHub repository for this project. I plan to create one soon to manage the source code and document progress.  

## 10/12/2025 - Complete the first version of code   

So I completed the first version of my air mouse project 
I did it in online esp32 simulator where for now it read the data and print it and also make a read to use code with everything this write correctly and check by ai for now when it get all the parts I am going test it and improve it for now I did not have new image so I am going to upload old one and i still have to update code in GitHub ![Screenshot 2025-10-05 161522.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgxOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--676c967484ff4639e16342af9f51d3ad9ec85097/Screenshot%202025-10-05%20161522.png)
